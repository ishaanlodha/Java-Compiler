# Java Compiler

A mini Java compiler implemented using Lex and Yacc. It supports while loops and switch case constructs alongwith functions and control statements. It maintains a dynamic symbol table with scope, memory and value, and provides the optimised intermediate code and the asbtract syntax tree. 
The compiler can be run using the following command. 
```
$ ./exec.out <.java_file>
```
